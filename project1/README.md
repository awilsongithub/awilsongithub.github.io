###Project Approach and Learnings
* Skills I wanted to reinforce: jQuery selectors and DOM manipulation. Data retrieval from objects and arrays via API or data internal to my file. Google Maps API. I wanted to expand on the Libary Locator I built in class that did some of the above. 
* Scope, Logic: Jim and James helped me organize my process. What to work on first and then expand upon. 
* BADASAP: Break App Down As Small As Possible.
* James encouraged me to wireframe it out in advance in detail.
* James showed my dev tools breakpoints. These helped me track down a variable update bug.
* Solving logic in a way that works for me.
* Using comments to plan and document 
* color picking and 
* Managing multiple files in Atom.
* v1, v2 to mitigate fear/risk of breaking my code.
