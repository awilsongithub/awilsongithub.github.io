###Project Approach
I started with skills I wanted to reinforce: jQuery selectors and DOM manipulation. Data retrieval from objects and arrays via API or data internal to my file. Google Maps API. I wanted to expand om the Libary Locator I built in class that did some of the above. 

###Scope, Logic, Wireframing
Jim and James helped me organize my process. What to work on first and then expand upon. Break Down As Small As Possible (BaDASAPp). 

###Learnings
Lots of little things beyond just code: Flagging, commenting, color picking and managing multiple files in Atom.
